IF DOING TEXT INPUT
	- Check valid. Should have a way to determine if, for the current question, a given input is valid.
		ex. add (3) is valid. add (<img>) is not.
	- When text is entered:
		Add a new div containing the given text.
		Div should be positioned outside of the set.
	- Element Div:
		- Clickable. Mainly for find () operations.
		- Draggable. For dragging into, out of set.
		- Should show that can be dragged & clicked. Will have to figure out a way to do this
	- Uset.fromUserInput ():
		- Reads every value within the set, takes values, creates set from values.
	- Trash Can:
		- Droppable.
		- When an element is dropped over the trash can, element is removed
			- div destroyed


	PROBABLY REUSABLE:
		- Element Div
			- Would have clicking, dragging that can be enabled, disabled.
			- Value
			- Event Handling:
				- onClick
				- onDragStop
				- onDragStart
				- ???
		- Droppable ?
		- fromUserInput () ?
		- ..


.... here's some notes.
	Drawing a model over the other model:
	 	   Take the User Model.
		   For every element that's not in the user model:
					Add the element
					Position it randomly, somewhere within the USet div
			 Take a nap
